### What should i learn to work deep with DataFactory ?


There are two big things you should learn

1. SELECT Query over more than one table  
In all variations - JOINS, UNIONS, PIVOT etc.

2. STORED PROCEDURES
This are scripts, written in SQL - they do Processes like import, export, move 

There are good online coures, e.g

Beside SQL you need good knowledge of datamodelling  - but his will come by time and trial & error.
